# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Description
This project predicts house prices using a machine learning model called **Linear Regression**. It uses data from the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques".

The model is trained to predict the **SalePrice** of houses based on:
- Ground Living Area (GrLivArea)
- Number of Bedrooms Above Ground (BedroomAbvGr)
- Number of Full Bathrooms (FullBath)

## 📁 Files Included
- `train.csv` — the dataset used for training the model.
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb` — the main Colab notebook containing the ML code.
- `README.txt` — this file.

## 📊 Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The dataset is loaded and cleaned.
2. Important features (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms) are selected.
3. Data is split into training and test sets.
4. A Linear Regression model is trained.
5. The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error and R² Score.
6. A new house price can be predicted using the model.

## ✅ Result
The model is able to predict house prices based on a few important features with reasonable accuracy.
